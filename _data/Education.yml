    description:
      - During my time at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), where I pursued a degree in 
       Mechanical Engineering, I developed a strong foundation in engineering principles while honing 
       my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and innovation. Throughout my studies, I actively engaged 
       in collaborative projects that challenged me to think critically and adapt to new technologies. 
       Whether it was designing mechanical systems, troubleshooting complex issues, or working with diverse teams, 
       I consistently sought out opportunities to learn and push boundaries. My passion for continuous learning and 
       creativity drove me to approach each challenge not just as a task, but as a chance to innovate and grow.
